  <p>An action a company takes to increase their stock price.</p>

  <Header>How do I profit off of them?</Header>
  <p>
    By buying 1 share <span class='italic'>before the effective date</span> of the
    reverse split that will be <span class='font-bold underline'>
      rounding up fractional shares

  <Header>What are the risks?</Header>
  <p>You can start with as little as $2-5</p>
  <p>
