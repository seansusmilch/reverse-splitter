## What is a reverse split?

An action a company takes to increase their stock price.

**You won't make millions overnight off this...**

I like to compare it to picking up a $5 bill off the ground. Takes little to
no effort, very little risk, for a decent payout relative to the amount of time it takes.

## How do I profit off of them?

By buying 1 share before the effective date of the
reverse split that will be rounding up fractional shares

## What are the risks?

You can start with as little as $2-5

Usually, companies that are performing reverse splits will have a stock
price of below $1, so you'd be risking less than $1 per trade.
